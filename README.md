## Banner Design Guideline

The optimal size for the website banner is 1920 x 543px.

The mobile safe area is the area where copy should sit so that it shows correctly on various screen size on any devices. I've prepared the Guides in a PSD file for design convenience. Please download it [here](https://github.com/viperfx07/rocksydney-wiki/raw/master/rocksydney_banner_guideline.psd).
